Create a simple interface ISaveable, that interface allows an object to be saved to some sort of storage medium.
The exact type of medium is not known to the interface. The interface will just specify two methods, one to return
an ArrayList of values to be saved and the other to populate the object's fields from an ArrayList (parameter).
Create a few sample classes that implement your Saveable interface.
Override the toString() method for each of your classes so that they can be easily printed to enable
the program to be tested easier.
In Main, write a method that takes an object that implements the interface as a parameter and
"saves" the values e.g. calls the method defined in the interface.
